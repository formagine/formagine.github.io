<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Even at its lowest fidelity levels, 3D printers and other manufacturing techniques can still take a long time without accounting for any unseen delays. For high precision or larger products, the cost can often be inaccessibly high. Certain shapes and scales, such as pieces large enough to wrap around an arm, can also be difficult to reproduce with a 3D printer. Printing large items is often unreasonable due to the time it would take to print in various sections and the expense of the filament required. This can be both incredibly frustrating and significantly restrict the pace of the iterative design process. </p>

<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>In traditional vacuum forming, a positive mold, or buck, is precisely machined into the desired shape. Due to the cost of making this mold, vacuum forming is typically done for high-volume production and manufacturing. Our team began by asking the question how could we make vacuum forming a desktop process or something that could be used in rapid prototyping? The answer was removing the buck from the equation. If the buck could be remade or change dynamically to the user's needs, massive savings in money and time could be achieved. The cost of vacuum forming would fall just to the cost of the plastic.</p>

<p>For the past 4 months, we have been designing a device that will combine a vacuum former with a bed of actuated pins. Our idea was inspired by the MIT's inFORM Dynamic Display.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>We are a team of 5 undergraduate Mechatronics engineering students at the University of Waterloo challenging the limits of rapid prototyping.</p>

<p>Sanjeevani is finishing up her final year of Mechatronics with a minor in AI at UWaterloo. She has previously done co-ops in mechanical, hardware, and product management, and has focused on software for robotics over recent terms; most recently as a SWE at Apple's Special Projects group and at Avidbots (autonomous robotics) before that. She has led all aspects of software projects â€“ from problem exploration and solution architecture to integration and optimization (notably in her projects at Apple, Avidbots, Synapse Technology and Grobo), and loves to leverage her background in design thinking and lean development to fully own and deliver projects. She also cofounded the first dedicated peer-mentorship program for Mechatronics, and has grown it to over 130 people. Feel free to reach and connect at https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjlakshmi/</p>

<p>Oliver has extensive work experience with IoT and embedded systems. He was published for work relating to leak detection and networking at SmartNets 2019. His work in the area includes electrical design and simulation (where he implemented a power management PCB), wireless network architecture design (including Bluetooth mesh network development), and extensive Bluetooth LE development (including programming a BLE-to-cloud hub). He has also worked extensively in IoT, including integrated device design for the AquaHacking competition (the team earned $15k and entry into a startup incubator). Oliver is engaging in integrated mechanical design for Formagine, in addition to software development.</p>
