<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Even at its lowest fidelity levels, 3D printers and other manufacturing techniques can still take a long time without accounting for any unseen delays. For high precision or larger products, the cost can often be inaccessibly high. Certain shapes and scales, such as pieces large enough to wrap around an arm, can also be difficult to reproduce with a 3D printer. Printing large items is often unreasonable due to the time it would take to print in various sections and the expense of the filament required. This can be both incredibly frustrating and significantly restrict the pace of the iterative design process. </p>

<h2>Our Solution</p>
<p>In traditional vacuum forming, a positive mold, or buck, is precisely machined into the desired shape. Due to the cost of making this mold, vacuum forming is typically done for high-volume production and manufacturing. Our team began by asking the question how could we make vacuum forming a desktop process or something that could be used in rapid prototyping? The answer was removing the buck from the equation. If the buck could be remade or change dynamically to the user's needs, massive savings in money and time could be achieved. The cost of vacuum forming would fall just to the cost of the plastic.</p>

<p>For the past 4 months, we have been designing a device that will combine a vacuum former with a bed of actuated pins. Our idea was inspired by the MIT's inFORM Dynamic Display.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>We are a team of 5 undergraduate Mechatronics enginerring students at the University of Waterloo challenging the limits of rapid prototyping.</p>
