<p>Hello again everyone! Welcome to another post where a majority is spent talking about how the pandemic has derailed our project and what we are doing to overcome these challenges!</p>

<p>Before we begin though, here's some good news from the team. 3D printing of the components that were designed in the previous term have begun and seeing these designs come to life is truly exciting!</p>

<p>In the image above, you can see the spindle starting to come together. The slide potentiometer and motor have been installed in their respective locations. Another view of this is provided below. </p>

<p>In addition to printing components for the spindle and assembling that, the team has also been 3D printing custom design jigs. Now, you may be wondering, "Custom design jigs? Whatever for?" Well, here's where we start talking about how the pandemic has derailed this project. Before the pandemic, much of the work needed to build the machine was to be completed by the team in a machine shop. We intended to drill and thread the 4300+ holes for our pinbed, use a bandsaw to cut our 1m long M3 rods, and build the outer casing ourselves. Due to the pandemic, however, we are unable to go to a machine shop and have been forced to find alternative methods to get all this work done. The pinbed luckily was easily outsourced to EMS at UWaterloo. While, this is an unexpected cost, this is exactly why we set aside a portion of the budget for unexpected expenses and so this is a non-issue. Below is our beautiful pinbed with all 4300+ holes drilled and threaded (special shoutout to Jeff for doing it all with the flex arm).</p>

<p>With the pinbed successfully taken care of, we were now faced with the problem of how we were going to cut 275 1m long M3 threaded rods into smaller 70mm pieces as precisely as possible. Well, that's where the custom jig comes in. In order to ensure that the pins are cut as precisely as possible and to speed up the process, custom jigs were designed and printed. An image of the printed jig in action is shown below. With this setup, 18 rods can be cut at once with a hacksaw and lining up the ends of the rods with the back of the jig ensures we get as close to a 70mm cut as possible. Reloading for the next cut is also easy with this setup. Simply remove the cut pieces and slide the rods all the way to back of the jig, clamp and start cutting. Currently, we are at 1000 pins cut of the goal of 4300! We are going to have such amazing muscles to look forward to once we manage to cut all 4300 pieces.</p>

<p>Finally, the outer casing of the machine which was to be built in the machine shop had to be built otherwise. The only solution that seemed wise at the time was to assemble in a team member's front yard with the necessary tools and go at it. So...that's exactly what we did!</p>

<p>Admittedly, this was not the wisest decision, considering it was extremely cold and the windchill was not pleasant. We did our best however and got a lot of good work completed in this time. There are only about two more pieces that need to be cut, and they are not essential to the operation of the machine and are not of a high priority.</p>

<p>Also, in case you were wondering how we kept warm since we couldn't exactly go into each other's houses, please take a look at this wonderful measuring cup full of hot chocolate that served us well and kept us nice and warm.</p>

<p>Despite the weather and lack of proper workspace and resources, we truly did have an amazing time working together after so long. It was a splendid time and makes us wonder how this term might have been had we been able to do everything the way we had initially intended to. Alas, that is out of our control. We can only enjoy the moment and enjoy we did! :)</p>
