<p>Today we have an exciting update for everyone. Our order from Digikey arrived! With all the PCB parts now in our possession, we can move forward with soldering, testing and other exciting embedded systems work!</p>

<p>The process of soldering brings many surprises as it brings our mistakes to light. There were sadly a few, but nothing that can't be fixed with another Digikey order haha.</p>

<p>Below are additional pictures of our soldering adventures. Check them out! </p>
