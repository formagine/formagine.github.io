Hello hello! We're here to let you know everything is on track and looking good.

A redesign of the GUI was required as the previous design could not process large files, but other than that everything is on track for the symposium!

We recently had a design and filming night and were able to get all the small design fixes complete and the LCD wired up. All that's left is calibration and test prints :D

<p>Yours Truly,</p>
