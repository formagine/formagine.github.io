<p>Today, we bring you the long awaited videos of our product in action! After many late nights and hard work in the Hacksmith shop, our product is finally ready for some test prints. Before we get to those videos though, let's quickly talk about changes that have been made and also the plans for the few days remaining before the symposium.</p>

<p>As we have gone through the building process, we have gone through many changes, some of which have been discussed in previous blog posts. The biggest changes recently pertain to the heating element of the machine. The heat gun and plenum combination we had intended to use did not pan out like our simulations predicted. The heating was very uneven across the plastic and we were unable to form with it. We were luckily able to source a heater from Hacksmith and now our product is equipped with a beautiful radiant heater that heats the plastic quickly and evenly.</p>

<p>Another major change was the locking mechanism for the plastic. It has been changed from two plates that are clamped together to wood that has been cut to have a forming area and handles. The plastic is held in place in the forming area with a metal shield that is locked with thumb screws. </p>

<p>The final noteworthy change is the spindle design. There were many issues with the spindle design impeded functionality, but a redesign was done to bring the components closer together to reduce the moment arm. With this change, the product is performing well except for the rare occasion wherein the motor melts the 3d printed parts. In order to prevent this from happening in the future, the spindle parts are being printed with PETG instead of PLA.</p>

<p>As for the coming days, we definitely intend to do test prints, but we also wish to improve performance so we have ordered new and better parts for the spindle. We are in the process of rebuilding the spindle with the new parts and hope to drastically improve the stability and reduce the build times. </p>

<p>Now, on to the fun stuff! We have two time lapse videos of our bed being shifted into the desired position. Look at Formagine Alpha go! </p>

<p>Hopefully, in the next post we will have some beautiful test prints to show you! Please look forward to them :D</p>
