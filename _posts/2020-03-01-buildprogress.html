<p>Hello again! It's been a while since the last post, but alas 4B is like that.</p>
<p>We have been making good progress! The electrical shelf is completed as seen in the header! The exterior casing, motion systems and gantry have also all been completed! Pictures are included below.</p>

<p>Embedded software and the user interface are also in a very good position right now! Moving forward the main focus is getting the heater operational and tested as well as installing the pinbed. The heater installations have been a little delayed as our simulations did not match up with reality. The heat gun's flow is not turbulent enough to evenly heat the plastic all across, as such a new heater has been obtained. Testing is in progress to ensure that the new heater has the ability to evenly heat the plastic. Once this is complete, it will be installed and more testing will be conducted.</p>
<p>As for the pinbed, it is also almost close to completion! We were able to outsource the rest of the cutting to the Engineering Student Machine Shop (EMS) and we got them all back recently. Below is a picture of less than half of them. There's too many pins to count to be honest...</p>

<p>We have started inserting the pins into the pinbed and we're about halfway there. Soon it will be ready to install and be tested! Our dreams are finally becoming a reality and it's amazing to see.</p>

<p>Please look forward to more updates and a video of the full system operation soon!</p>
