<p>You know how people comment "FIRST" on a post or YouTube video? What's the blogging equivalent? Anyways FIRST post, woohoo!</p>

<p>To start us off, a late Happy New Year to our fans. Let's make 2021 everything that 2020 took away from us! Only if we get out of this panorama though.</p>

<p>Anyways, enough lame memes. Today, January 11th, marks the beginning of a new term. Since, this is the 8th study term that the team will be trying to survive, you would think that it's no big deal. Just normal everyday university student things. BUT! You'd be wrong! This is our final term! Our last study term! The only thing standing between us and graduation are these four months. So not only do we have a renewed vigor from leaving 2020 behind, we have a never before seen determination to survive this term unscathed! This final year design project is no match for us.</p>

<p>To start off the new term, the team got together today to discuss game plan moving forward. We have revamped our Gantt Chart with the new deadlines and accelerated plans, especially for software, and we are ready for whatever this term throws at us!</p>

<p>That's all we have to say for today. Happy beginning of term to everyone! Let's go out with a bang!</p>

<p>Yours Truly,</p>
