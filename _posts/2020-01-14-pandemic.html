<p>Haha so did you know that the province of Ontario not only extended the lockdown but implemented a stay at home order?</p>

<p>Well, they did.</p>

<p>How does one construct a whole mechatronics project, especially the mechanical portions, in this pandemic??</p>

<p> Well, let us tell you how we are going about it.</p>

<p>To start, it is essential to identify the areas which are most heavily affected by the pandemic. In our case, that would be parts acquisition, machine shop unavailability, and a team member stuck on the other side of the country. The parts acquisition issue results in a lot of extra work for the team as all parts must be sourced from other local options that do not require a business address for delivery. While it is a lot to have to source half the BOM from a new place, it is not impossible. As for the machine shops being unavailable, this sadly requires the team to source most of the work that we could have completed ourselves if we had access to a machine shop. This will take a hit on our budget, but luckily we planned for this! Our extra space in the budget will now be put towards sourcing our machining from local companies. Finally, the issue of the stranded team member, well we simply made all his contributions remote.</p>

<p>Nothing can stop our team. We are going to make this project a reality!</p>

<p>We'd also like to say good luck to all other project teams experiencing the same sort of troubles. The pandemic sucks, but we are going to make it!</p>
