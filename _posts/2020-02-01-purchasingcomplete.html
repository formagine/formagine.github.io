<p>Hello again! It's been about 2 weeks since the last post, but alas 4B is like that. We'll be trying to update more regularly from now on!</p>
<p>To start off this update, I'd just like to say Happy February to everyone reading this! Can you believe we're already through one month of 2021? Time really flies by. This also means that we as a team are only 3 months away from finishing our last term of university and more importantly only a month and a half away from finishing this project! This is both exciting and nervewracking to think about, but hopefully we'll have a wonderful final product that we can be proud of and we can end our last term off with a BANG!</p>

<p>Anyways, let's talk updates! Last time we checked in on here, we were complaining about how the pandemic makes it extremely hardly to pull off a highly mechanical project such as ours. This is due to lockdown implemented in our province. Essentially, the lockdown meant that the company we were using as a shipping address for parts could no longer accept our shipments for us and on top of that, the machine shops we intended to machine our parts at ourselves were all shut down. This resulted in a lot of last minute scrambling to source those parts from other companies that did not require a business address but this also meant a lot of adjustments in the models as we had to use standard parts in imperial units and not the specialized metric parts we initially intended on using. After many adjustments and parts research, we were able to finalize our models and move forward with purchasing. As for machining, we simply had no choice but to submit machining requests to shops and pay for services instead of doing it ourselves. At this point in time, everything has been purchased and machining requests have been submitted! We are ready to start construction! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰</p> 

<p>Let's take a look at the parts that we've recently acquired! First off, we have finally obtained our 275 1m long M3 threaded rods! These rods are going to be used as the pins in our pinbed. We intend for there to be over 4000 pins each at a length of about 60mm each, so you can probably tell we have our work cut out for us in terms of accurately cutting the rods and ensuring they seamlessly screw into the pinbed. Since we no longer have access to machine shops, we cannot use any of the machinery we intended to use to make this an easy and smooth process, so please do look forward to the blog post where we discuss how we were up all night trying to ensure that we have the right amount of pins and they all move seamlessly in the vertical direction. In case you were wondering what happens if we run into any troubles with cutting and lose a rod, worry not for we have ordered around 25 extra rods for this very purpose! We are always prepared for the worst. In the picture below, the rods are laid out in bundles next to the packaging they came in. Please take a second to admire these beautiful rods.</p>

<p>In addition to the threaded rods, we also received our bearings and springs for the spindle assembly! As we have not put out any posts explaining the specifics of our design yet, spindle may be an unfamiliar term to you readers, but once we have posts explaining them, they will be linked! For now, simply think of the spindle as the mechanism that moves from pin to pin shifting the height of the the pin. So, with these parts in our possession, we can finally get started on the construction of the gantry and we could not be more excited! We will be making update posts on construction of this section very soon, so stay tuned! In the meantime, please admire how tiny these bearings and springs are. They are very precious to us.</p>

<p>Finally, the last critical item that we were having somewhat of a crisis over has also arrived! In order to fully realize our spindle design, we needed a 6mm aluminum hex bar. While we are flexible about the size to some extent, we simply were unable to find these hex bars at any company that didn't require a business address! Thankfully, we discovered a wonderful hack. Some companies that only ship to businesses will ship anywhere as long as you have a company or school you're associated to. Since, we're associated to the University of Waterloo, we just included that in the company field and voila,we had out parts. Thanks to this, we now have a beautiful 6mm aluminum hex bar and a spare in our possession. This was discovered in some last minute Hail Marys but alas if only we'd known about this before we tried to source everything locally. The one good thing however is that we saved a lot of money on shipping and conversion rates, so the massive redesigns and research may have been worth it ultimately.</p>

<p>It's really nice and exciting to see everything finally coming together for the team. Software work and electrical work is coming along nicely and soon we will have the mechanical aspects all caught up with the software and electrical which is truly wonderful. We are truly starting to become something more than a group of engineering students. We're on our way to being a company and recently that was made official, haha.</p>

<p>Somehow this receipt really made things feel official. We are Formagine now.</p>

<p>Anyways, thank you for reading these ramblings. We will be back very soon with a few posts describing aspects of our project in depth. Please look forward to it!</p>

<p>Yours Truly,</p>
