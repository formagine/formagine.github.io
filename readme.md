Who Are We?
===========
Group Picture!

We are four mechatronics engineering students at the University of Waterloo that are creating a desktop vacuum forming device with a reusable buck! This website will follow our progress while building and testing the machine. Our goal is to have a completely functional machine by March 19, 2021.
Here's a closer look at our team:

Charles Holtforster
