Who Are We?
===========

We are four mechatronics engineering students at the University of Waterloo that are creating a desktop vacuum forming device with a reusable buck! This website will follow our progress while building and testing the machine. Our goal is to have a completely functional machine by March 19, 2021.
Here's a closer look at our team:

#Charles Holtforster

Charles is the electrical design lead and designer of the linear motion gantry based.

#Diontae Jaegli

Diontae is the lead mechanical designer and has also been conducting simulations to validate the results of our estimates. 

#Sanjeevani Lakshmivarahan

Sanjeevani is the software architect of the team and will be tackling both the software controls of the device and a way of slicing 3D models for the pin array. 

#Sai Shruthi Srinivasan

Oliver is a mechanical and electrical designer. He developed the linear sensor to control pin actuation.

The Formagine Vacuum Former
========
In traditional vacuum forming, a positive mold, or buck, is precisely machined into the desired shape. Due to the cost of making this mold, vacuum forming is typically done for high-volume production and manufacturing. Our team began by asking the question how could we make vacuum forming a desktop process or something that could be used in rapid prototyping? The answer was removing the buck from the equation. If the buck could be remade or change dynamically to the user's needs, massive savings in money and time could be achieved. The cost of vacuum forming would fall just to the cost of the plastic. 

For the past 4 months, we have been designing a device that will combine a vacuum former with a bed of actuated pins. 
Our idea was inspired by the [MIT's inFORM Dynamic Display](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/inform/).
